# Core Java Book exercises

This module aims to practice with and showcase Java features in [Core Java](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/core-java-volume/9780137673810/)

Also, I will write notes here for each chapter. I will only focus on those features I was not familiar with or are new 
in Java 17.

## Chapter 4 Objects and Classes
### Record
- From Java 16
- Immutable data class(all field is final)
- Not completely immutable if one of the fields is a reference

#### Example: [RecordExample](https://github.com/macknever/demoRepo/blob/master/exercises/src/main/java/com/lawrence/corejava/objectsandclasses/RecordExample.java)
